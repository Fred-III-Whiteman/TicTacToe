# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe, Exes n' Oes if you will, O'sies even.


### TODO
- [ ] COMMENT THE CODE!!!!

- [ ] add functionality to .start
    - [ ] Single-player should function as is
    - [ ] Multi-Player should use the minimax instead (will not the the curser hover for 'O's)
    - [ ] Once a button is pressed hide the .start area and display the .gemType

- [ ] Incorporate the .cover class and block the user from selecting or hovering over tiles

-  [] add functionality to .gameType
    - [ ] If single player it should read "Vs. AI"
    - [ ] If multi-player it should say "Player 1's turn/ Player 2's turn"
    - [ ] Hide once game is over

- [ ] Add functionality to the quit button
    - [ ] it should refresh the page or return it to the start state

- [ ] Work in the "miniMax" algorithm and try to get a better understanding of it / write it in a more readable way

- [ ] Add Colour to the tiles during the endgame state?

- [ ] Add a "coin flip" so its not always Player 1 starting the game?

- [ ] Refactor all code so its more semantic/readable

- [ ] Incorporate onto Fred-III-Whiteman.io
